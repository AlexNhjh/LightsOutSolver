Collaboration with Joseph Carman as part of his senior project

We sought to solve the game Lights Out using linear algebra. This project includes solutions to the 3x3 up to the 7x7 boards for the classic version of Lights Out,
as well as solutions to our new variant the "Knight's Move".

Not all board sizes have solutions for every configuration.
